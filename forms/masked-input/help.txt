	9 = 0-9
	C = A-Z and accents
	c = A-Z
	* = Any character


Special rules

	E = (Except) exception
	O = (Only) only


Mask creation

	Simple masks:
	In this kind of mask the user can't type more characters than the amount of
	characters in the mask.
	Example:
	telephone = (99)9999-9999
	date = 99/99/9999


	Special mask "rule^exceptions":
	This kind of mask is composed ty two parts, separated by "^",
	the left side specified the rule and the right one, the exceptions for the selected rule.
	Example:
	9^abc = The rule is to accept only numbers "9" and the exception are the characters a, b and c
	c^123 = Accepts only a-z characters and the exception are the numbers 1, 2 and 3


	Use of the special rules:
	it's similar to the special mask, but the left side has a different meaning,
	can be "E" (any character, except...) and "O" (only...)
	Example:
	E^abc: Accepts any character, except a, b and c
	O^123: Only allows the characters 1, 2 e 3
