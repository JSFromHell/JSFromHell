Constructor

	Bezier(p0: Object, p1: Object, c0: Object, c1: Object)
	
		Generates an instance de Bezier. The points can be generated from the method "Bezier.point".
		
			p0 defines the origin point of the curve 
			p1 defines the end point of the curve
			c0 defines the point which has influence over the p0 argument
			c1 defines the point which has influence over the p1 argument			
			
	


Class Methods

	Bezier.point(x: Integer, y: Integer): Object
	Returns an object containing two properties, x and y.


Methods

	Bezier.getCoordinates(position: Float): Object
	
		Returns the coordinates of a point given its "position" on the curve.
		
			position number from 0 up to 1 which specifies the position of the point (example: 0 = beginning, 0.5 = middle, 1 = end)
		
	
	Bezier.plot(callback: Function(point: Object, currentPosition: Float): void): Object
	
		Draws the curve.
		
			callback function which will be called for each point that needs to be drawed, receives as first argument the coordinates of the point (contains the x and y properties), the second argument is the current position, which varies from 0 (0%) up to 1 (100%)
