	dotLineIntersection(px: Integer, py: Integer, x0: Integer, y0: Integer, x1: Integer, y1: Integer): Object
	
		Returns an object containing two properties (x and y), that specify the intersection point between a
		line and an imaginary line that passes in the point and it's also perpendicular (makes an angle of 90°) to the same line.
		
			px x coord of the point
			py y coord of the point
			x0 x coord of the line's A point
			y0 y coord of the line's A point
			x1 x coord of the line's B point
			y1 y coord of the line's B point
