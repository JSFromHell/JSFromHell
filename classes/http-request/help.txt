Methods

	Observation:
	There are two ways of setting the callbacks, if you pass a simple function, it will be called for all the events 
	of the XMLHTTPRequest, the other way is to set just the desired events on the callback, using the following sintax:
	{eventName: callback, eventName2: callback, ...}, where the allowed events are:
	
		open = called after the request start
		sent = called after the request data is sent
		load = called multiple timples while the content is retrieved
		end = called in the transference end
	


	HTTPRequest.isSupported(void): Boolean
	Returns true if the browser supports the creation of the XMLHTTPRequest object.
	
	HTTPRequest.get(url: String, [params: Object = null], [handler: Function(xhr: XMLHTTPRequest): void = null], [waitResponse: Boolean = false]): Boolean
	
		Makes a request through GET and returns true if the request is created succesfully.
		
			url request url
			params parameters hashmap, it will be serialized and added on the end of the url as query string
			handler callback that will be called on the XMLHTTPRequest events, receives as argument the own XMLHTTPRequest object
			waitResponse indicates if the request will be synchronized (true) or asynchronized (false)				
		
	

	HTTPRequest.post(url: String, [params: Object = null], [handler: Function(xhr: XMLHTTPRequest): void = null], [waitResponse: Boolean = false]): Boolean
	
		Makes a request through POST and returns true if the request is created succesfully.
		
			url request url
			params parameters hashmap, it will be serialized and on sent within the POST
			handler callback that will be called on the XMLHTTPRequest events, receives as argument the own XMLHTTPRequest object
			waitResponse indicates if the request will be synchronized (true) or asynchronized (false)				
		
	

	HTTPRequest.request(method: String, url: String, [params: Object = null], [handler: Function(xhr: XMLHTTPRequest): void = null], [headers: Object = null] [waitResponse: Boolean = false]): Boolean
	
		Makes a request and returns true if the request is created succesfully.
		
			method method that will be used to make the request		
			url request url
			params parameters hashmap, it will be serialized and on sent within the POST
			handler callback that will be called on the XMLHTTPRequest events, receives as argument the own XMLHTTPRequest object
			headers hashmap containing additional headers		
			waitResponse indicates if the request will be synchronized (true) or asynchronized (false)				
		
				

	HTTPRequest.getConnection(void): XMLHTTPRequest
	Returns a new XMLHTTPRequest object or null on error.

	HTTPRequest.formatParams(params: Object): String
	
		Serializes the hashmap into the "query string" format.
		
			params object which the properties will be serialized
